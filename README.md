## About this document
This document is a way of documenting and presenting myself, just like me, it is constantly evolving.

```PS: This document isn't a way to avoid personal contact :) ```

## About me
I am 34 years old, married and the father of one child. I was born in Rio Grande do Sul, where I currently live, I lived in SP for 9 years and chose to return to my hometown due to the pandemic.
I have a degree in business administration and statistics, I also have an MBA in Biga data and Analytics. My professional background is basically between HR and Data areas. Since 2014 I started working with People Analytics and since then, I have been improving my knowledge and gaining experience in areas such as Finance, Risks and continuing my work in People.
I runned by companies like: Walmart, PepsiCo, Hotmart, Ferrero, Carrefour and EBANX (currently).

My actual role as a **Corporate Analytics Manager** is:

* **Team Colaboration:** Incentiving the team workers to act closely with other teams, such as IT, other data analytics teams, data scientists, and business teams, to ensure data requirements are met and data management best practices are adhered to followed. This can include defining data modeling standards, creating efficient workflows for data acquisition and integration, and facilitating collaboration between different stakeholders.

### My availability
* Although I have areas where my work is more present, I am always open to discussions about analytics and data for other areas
* I like to exchange ideas on different subjects, but in a professional environment, giving and receiving feedback is a positive way to build a good relationship.

### Behaviors that I appreciate 
* **Critical Thinking:** Look at a process and always ask yourself, "What can I improve on it?" There's always room for improvement.
* **Transparency:** Be clear and transparent in your statements. Bringing the problem or situation directly is always the best alternative.

* **Organization and discipline:** Organization and discipline are fundamental to being able to achieve our objectives.

* **Balance:** If you ask me what I appreciate most in my personal and professional life, the answer is balance. I believe that balance is the solution to most problems and with an addition, without harming relationships.
